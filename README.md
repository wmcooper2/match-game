A vocabulary building game for elementary school English lessons.

## Purpose/Goal
To have a match game where I can control the images and vocabulary used in the classroom.

## Operation
* Click on the Vocabulary and Cards links at the top to change the vocab and layout respectively.
* Click on the Game link (appears after you click on the vocab or cards links) to return to the game.

## Tech/Libraries Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* ReactRouter
* Bootstrap

## Problems/Solutions
* Adapting the grid to flex properly and maintain a consistent card shape was an issue at first, but I figure that by setting the img elements to a relative size I could get a nicer image without the wierdness that comes with stretching.
* The teams that I had originally added to the first version proved to just be a time waster with students. It's best not to give them too many choices because they (being students) will find every opportunity to not stay on track.
* Bootstrap was proving to be really annoying in this project. I ended up having to put stylings directly into the React components to get the effects I wanted.
* The original CSS coloring scheme was also something that "took away" from the intent of the project. The point is to have a _simple_ way to practice vocabulary in class (that I controlled completely from the images to the layout, etc).

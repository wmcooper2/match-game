A vocabulary building game for elementary school English lessons.

## Purpose/Goal
To have a match game where I can control the images and vocabulary used in the classroom.

## Operation

## Tech/Libraries Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* ReactRouter
* Bootstrap

## Problems/Solutions
* This app is not meant for small screens. Maybe I will adapt for small screens later, but that is not a high priority for me now.
* Accidentally created a bug with the recent update. Now, the cards don't appear right away. If you select a card count or vocabulary, then return to the game the cards will appear. Working on a solution for this now (May 23rd, 2020).
